# ConsoleRGBColors
Unfortunately, the .NET core does not have the ability for professional color schemes, and it was fun to play with ANSI. The result was this package
## Intall
```bash
dotnet add package ConsoleRGBColors --version 1.0.0
```   
or you can clone the repo and build the source :
```bash
git clone git@github.com:AmirMahdyJebreily/ConsoleRGBColors.git
```
## Using
To use ConsoleRGBColors, you must first add the following namespace:
```csharp
using ConsoleRGBColors;
```
